# scale_list

a simple web page that displays scales and fingerings

## Usage

if you have clojure and lein installed, it should suffice to execute the
run script from the top directory

## bugs/todo

* some ratios in scale descriptions are being parsed wrong
* the frequencies_rec function should be tail recursive or turned into
  an iverative version
* currently the svg fails to display in firefox
